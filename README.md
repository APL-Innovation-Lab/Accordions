# Accordions

The Accordion content type is a versatile and interactive feature designed to enhance the user experience on the Austin Public Library website. This content type allows for the efficient organization of information in a collapsible format, enabling users to expand and collapse sections of content as needed. Accordion elements are particularly useful for FAQs, step-by-step guides, and any content where space conservation and user engagement are priorities.

## Adherence to USWDS Recommendations

In developing the Accordion content type, we are committed to following the recommendations provided by the United States Web Design System (USWDS). The USWDS is a set of design guidelines developed to ensure federal websites are accessible, fast, and easy to use. By aligning with these recommendations, we ensure that our Accordion content type:

- **Enhances Accessibility:** Ensures content is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. This aligns with our goal to make the library's digital resources available to everyone, following best practices in web accessibility.
- **Promotes Usability:** Adopts a user-centered design approach, making information easy to find and interact with. The collapsible nature of Accordions helps users navigate content more efficiently, reducing information overload by allowing users to focus on one section at a time.
- **Ensures Consistency:** Maintains visual and functional consistency across the library's digital platform, providing a cohesive user experience. Using USWDS guidelines helps standardize our design and interaction patterns.

## Implementation Details

When implementing the Accordion content type, consider the following best practices to maximize effectiveness and accessibility:

- **Clear Labeling:** Each Accordion header should clearly describe the content it expands to help users find information quickly.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure Accordions are fully navigable via keyboard, allowing users to expand and collapse sections without relying on a mouse.
- **Aria-Expanded Attributes:** Use ARIA attributes to indicate the state (expanded or collapsed) of each Accordion section, improving screen reader support.
